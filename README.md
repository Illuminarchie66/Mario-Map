This is the interactive map of the areas around Peach's Castle from the Mario franchise! We hope to update it soon with additional maps, of the entire Mushroom Kingdom, and a map of the Mario world. 

To view this map you can go to the webstie: http://mario-map-project.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

The Mushroom icons represent areas with multiple locations, like town plazas. The Fireflower icons represent locations, specific places like houses. The Star represents landmarks, such as Peach's Castle. You can toggle these with the respective buttons. Additionally, there are arrows showing what is in the distance, and vehicle icons, pointing out notable vehicles in the map.

If you run this locally you can run the commands

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python application.py`

And then you can navigate to the domain `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the map. 

If you want to add waypoints to the map, or change existing waypoints, you can edit the `static/popups/Waypoints.csv` document. 

All characters and locations depicted are owned by Nintendo.
